 * Every property-scoped capability WaslProp currently backs with real

 * pattern (src/platform/capabilities.ts). Controllers/services never check
 * `role === 'PROPERTY_MANAGER'`; they call the central AuthorizationService,
 * which resolves a role's effective capabilities and checks them here.
 *
 * `capability` is stored as a plain string (not a Prisma enum) on
 * OrganisationRolePermission deliberately: adding a new capability must
 * never require a schema migration, only a code change to this file plus
 * (optionally) an organisation override row. A capability that doesn't
 * appear in CAPABILITIES below is never granted, even if an override row
 * for it somehow exists (defensive — see AuthorizationService).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT included (no real functionality behind them yet):
 * - documents.* — no document storage feature exists.
 * - levies.*, financials.*, funds.* — explicitly out of scope for this
 *   milestone (M11 strata levy/fund business rules are still unconfirmed).
 * - approvals.* as a standalone resource — "Approval & Acceptance" is not
 *   a separate entity/route in this codebase; it's the workflow embedded
 *   in ContractorQuote (workflowMode/approve/reject) and WorkOrder status.
 *   See quotes.approve.
