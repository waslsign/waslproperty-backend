 * The one place WaslProp answers "can(user, capability, propertyId?)".

 *
 * Resolution order (conceptually: defaults -> org overrides -> membership
 * -> effective capability -> property scope):
 *
 * 1. OWNER/ADMIN (OrganisationMembership.role) — full organisation access,
 *    unchanged from pre-existing behaviour. PROPERTY_MANAGER/
 *    FACILITY_MANAGER are never treated as equivalent to this.
 * 2. MEMBER (OrganisationMembership.role) — exactly the read access MEMBER
 *    already had (every list/get route in these modules had no role check
 *    at all before this milestone) — see ORG_MEMBER_LEGACY_CAPABILITIES.
 *    Never broadened by this change.
 * 3. PropertyMembership — a user with no OrganisationMembership at all
 *    (pure property-scoped user, or a resident) is resolved via their
 *    PropertyContact's ACTIVE PropertyMembership rows. Each membership's
 *    role is resolved to an effective capability set (system default,
 *    overridden per-organisation by OrganisationRolePermission rows) and
 *    only applies to that membership's own propertyId — never the whole
 *    organisation.
 *
 * A user can hold multiple PropertyMemberships with different roles across
 * different properties (e.g. TENANT on A, PROPERTY_MANAGER on B) — each is
 * resolved independently; capabilities never leak from one property to
 * another.
